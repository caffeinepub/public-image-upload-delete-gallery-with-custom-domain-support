  "summary": "Frontend UI and theming were added (header/hero/banner, uploader, gallery grid/cards) plus custom-domain runtime config and a written CUSTOM_DOMAIN.md guide. However, the backend image APIs and frontend data hooks appear to be placeholders/non-functional based on the diff, and the required generated static image files themselves are not shown as added. Internet Identity/auth scaffolding was added even though the app is specified to work without authentication.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Implement backend image storage APIs (upload/list/fetch/delete) that work without authentication and return required metadata.",
      "reason": "backend/main.mo only includes an imported mixin with no visible upload/list/fetch/delete methods or return shapes; frontend hooks explicitly warn that backend methods are 'not yet available' and return empty/mock data, indicating the API contract is not implemented/exposed end-to-end.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Frontend must actually upload, list, display, and delete images via backend APIs with loading/error states.",
      "reason": "While UI components exist, the data layer is stubbed: list returns [] with a warning, upload simulates progress and returns a mock success, and delete logs a warning without calling a backend method. This prevents gallery population and real delete/upload behavior.",
