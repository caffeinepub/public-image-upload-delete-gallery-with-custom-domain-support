# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the Image Gallery page so the gallery loads correctly instead of showing an error.

**Planned changes:**
- Resolve the runtime error shown in the Gallery section (“actorAny.listBlobs is not a function”).
- Ensure the “Browse all uploaded images” area successfully fetches and displays uploaded images.
- Keep the existing “Try Again” behavior working once the underlying load issue is fixed.

**User-visible outcome:** The Image Gallery page loads the list of uploaded images successfully, without the “Failed to Load Gallery” error.
